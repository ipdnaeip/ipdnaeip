Hey, I'm ipdnaeip. I've been interested in programming since I played my first game, but struggled and moved on. I'm returning to try to get back into it and make something for myself and others to enjoy. I'm starting off with minecraft modding as it's a great game with a great community and I'll be able to enjoy what I make too.
